                    When asphalt weakens or diminishes due to age, weather, or lack of maintenance, you may think it's the end of it's life. That's where asphalt overlay comes in handy. You can expand the lifespan of your asphalt greatly. We will locate any weak areas in the sub-grade, repair them, and overlay your existing asphalt. We recommended getting an overlay when your asphalt has large potholes, ruts, or low areas that hold water. If you're unsure if you need an asphalt overlay we will come to you and determine what your asphalt needs.
